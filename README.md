# StepByStep calculator.

This was a simple project and all of a sudden grew up into this massive project of me wanting to integrate a lot of things. If you are looking for a calculator for the teminal that is feature rich, this kinda might be it? 

# This doesn't have a gui!

Just wanted to throw that as a header so that even lazy folks scrolling hastily can see ;)

# Features
 Okay, the good stuff now. 
 - This guy is packed with the ability to, well, solve your statements step by step(in case you hadn't guessed that already). 
 - Solving quadratic equations is a breeze! (like really super duper easy. All you do is enter 3 values. )
 - Simple stuff like factorials, working with infinity, some decent trigonometry, etc. is obviously here.
 - Absolute values are cool. So absolute values are integrated!
 - Pre-built constants, of course.
 - Complex numbers
 - And many other quality of life features that you may or may not directly interact with.
- Goddamn **perfect** Backets autocompletion. (Well, pretty close to perfect. :D)
 - ..
 - .

## Built using Python

So, basically, i built this "thing" as a means to learn python. So, its COMPLETELY written in vanilla python.

# For devs.
If you are interested in helping me improve the algorithms i have for stuff like bracket autocompletion, you can straight up contact me in [Messenger](facebook.com/adarsha.acharya.me). Any help will be **MASSIVELY** appreciated. Thanks in advance ;).

## Simple commands
Literally one letter commands, mostly. Super easy to start. Everything works just as you expect. You're welcome!

Quadratic roots? easy.

I would gladly accept any help regarding improvements or bug fixes that you'd like to suggest.
